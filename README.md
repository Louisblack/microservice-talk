# Building Micro Services with Spring Cloud and Docker

These are the code examples from my talk at the Milton Keynes Java User 
Group on 13th July 2016 about micro services and related tools including:

* [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
* [Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [Watchtower](https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/watchtower)

Other concepts touched upon include infrastructure as code principles and
obviously the pros and cons of micro service architecture.
